# VirtualBox

The VirtualBox organization is the home of Oracle's popular virtualization software running on many operating systems
using AMD/Intel/ARM processors. It allows running a broad range of operating systems in a virtual machine (VM) with
a wide selection of virtual hardware options. VirtualBox offers a user-friendly graphical user interface (without
excluding the possibility to run VMs in the background), flexible networking features and is especially strong with
interactive workloads.

It is largely open-source code, inviting community contributions in all areas. A limited amount of functionality is
provided as part of the Oracle VirtualBox Extension Pack which is closed source.
